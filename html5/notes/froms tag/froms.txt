forms are used to collect user's data such as name,email,phone_number etc..,
Eg: login, registration, feedback,contact,admission,
attendance form, messages,subscribe,search, forgot password etc..,

To take user's data we can use a self closing element named
'input'
Every input will have following attributes:
  -- type: it defines the type of input it can take
  -- placeholder: Dummy text to hold the place until actual value comes
  -- id : used to identify the input uniquely
  -- name : name is the variable by which value is sent to server
Label Tag: label is used to select certain elements and it needed to be connected with input's id (for attribute)
form tag also have attributes such as 
  -- action: contains the path of server(where the form to be submitted)
  -- method: it defines the way to send the values
       -- GET: get shows all the values in  URL
       -- POST: post will not show the values in the URL
